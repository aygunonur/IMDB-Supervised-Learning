-In this project, I'll use the "IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews" dataset that I got from kaggle. This dataset consists of 50,000 comments. I'm trying to predict whether the comment is positive or negative using artificial neural networks. Finally, I'll write my own comment and check whether it will make a positive or negative comment.
